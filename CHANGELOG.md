## [1.9.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Fixed a race where rapidly toggling Enabled could leave the camera running while Dorso was disabled.
- Added regression test coverage to ensure the camera session and app enabled state stay in sync.

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to [@Shadow1363](https://github.com/Shadow1363) for reporting and isolating this issue in [#68](https://github.com/tldev/dorso/issues/68)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Analytics data now migrates on launch from legacy `Posturr/analytics.json` into `Dorso/analytics.json` after rebrand updates.
- Legacy and current analytics are merged per day so cumulative monitoring time, slouch duration, and slouch events are preserved.
- Legacy analytics files are retained after migration for safety.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-16

### Changed
- Rebranded from Posturr to Dorso — new name, same app. All settings and data carry over automatically.

### Fixed
- Camera detection now reliably resumes after screen sleep, screen saver, or screen lock
- Camera session startup now verifies the session is actually running and logs errors on failure

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to [@DengNaichen](https://github.com/DengNaichen) for fixing the sleep/wake detection issue in [PR #63](https://github.com/tldev/dorso/pull/63)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-12

- Thanks to [@SHxKM](https://github.com/SHxKM) for reporting high CPU usage in AirPods mode!

## [1.5.9] - 2026-02-03

### Changed
- "Blur when away" toggle is now disabled in AirPods mode since this feature requires camera-based face detection

## [1.5.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- Switching to AirPods tracking without calibration now correctly pauses the app instead of incorrectly showing "Good Posture"

## [1.5.7] - 2026-02-03
