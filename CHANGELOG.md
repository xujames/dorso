- Camera session startup now verifies the session is actually running and logs errors on failure

### Acknowledgments
- Thanks to [@DengNaichen](https://github.com/DengNaichen) for fixing the sleep/wake detection issue in [PR #63](https://github.com/tldev/dorso/pull/63)

- Cleaner calibration instructions ("Look at the top-left corner" instead of "Screen 1 TOP-LEFT")
- Keyboard shortcuts display as visual keycaps during calibration
- Settings window remembers its position between opens

### Fixed

## [1.5.9] - 2026-02-03

### Changed
- "Blur when away" toggle is now disabled in AirPods mode since this feature requires camera-based face detection

## [1.5.8] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- Switching to AirPods tracking without calibration now correctly pauses the app instead of incorrectly showing "Good Posture"

## [1.5.7] - 2026-02-03
