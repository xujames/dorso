# Claude Code Instructions for Dorso

## Releasing

### Ship It (Full Release Workflow)

When the user says "ship it", perform the complete release workflow:

1. **Pull latest changes** with `git pull --rebase origin main` - ALWAYS do this first before committing
2. **Bump version** in `build.sh` (both `VERSION` and `BUILD_NUMBER`)
3. **Commit** cleanup/feature changes with proper attribution
4. **Merge** to main (if on a feature branch)
5. **Run `./release.sh X.Y.Z`** - builds, signs, notarizes, creates GitHub release, updates and pushes the Sparkle appcast
6. **Update release notes** with user-friendly description via `gh release edit`
7. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with new version entry
8. **Update README.md** contributors section if applicable
9. **Commit and push** changelog/readme updates
10. **Comment on PR/issue** thanking contributor and linking to release

### GitHub Release (Direct Distribution)

**IMPORTANT: Before releasing, always check existing releases and tags:**
```bash
gh release list --limit 5
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5
```
Only proceed if the version you're about to release doesn't already exist.

Always use the release script for GitHub releases:
```bash
./release.sh 1.0.X
```

This script handles:
- Building the app
- Code signing with Developer ID
- Apple notarization
- DMG creation with drag-to-Applications
- ZIP archive
- Git tagging
- GitHub release creation

**Never manually create GitHub releases** - the script ensures proper signing and notarization.

### After Running release.sh
The script creates generic release notes. **You must update them** with specific changes using:
```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's New

### Bug Fix (or Feature, Improvement, etc.)
- **Short title** - Description of what changed and why it matters.

### Also in this release
- Any other notable points

## Installation

1. Download `Dorso-vX.Y.Z.dmg` or `Dorso-vX.Y.Z.zip`
2. Drag `Dorso.app` to Applications
3. Launch normally - no warnings!
4. Grant camera permission and complete calibration

## Requirements
- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later

)"
```

**Writing good release notes:**
- Keep it simple and user-focused - describe the benefit, not the implementation
- Avoid technical jargon (e.g., "brandCyan color" → "consistent styling")
- Don't repeat commit messages verbatim - synthesize changes into what users care about
- One clear sentence is better than a list of technical details
- Example: "Consistent styling across Settings and Analytics windows" instead of "Redesigned analytics window with brand-consistent styling, replaced shadows with borders, updated color scheme"

### Acknowledgments
When implementing features or fixes from GitHub issues, always give credit to the person who suggested it:
- In the GitHub release notes: "Thanks to @username for suggesting this!"
- In CHANGELOG.md: Add an `### Acknowledgments` section with a link to their GitHub profile
- In README.md: Add them to the Contributors section with a brief description of their contribution
- Comment on the issue thanking them and linking to the release

Note: Issues auto-close when referenced with "Closes #N" in commit messages. If you try to close an issue and it's already closed, just add a thank-you comment instead.

### Update CHANGELOG.md
After updating the GitHub release notes, also update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry:
- Add the new version section at the top (after the header)
- Use Keep a Changelog format with `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed` sections as appropriate
- Include the release date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Commit and push the changelog update

### App Store Release
For App Store submissions, run these steps after the GitHub release:

```bash
cd /Users/tjohnell/projects/dorso

# 1. Build for App Store (excludes private APIs)
./build.sh --appstore

# 2. Copy to appstore folder and sign
rm -rf build-appstore/Dorso.app
cp -r build/Dorso.app build-appstore/
cd build-appstore

codesign --force --options runtime \
    --entitlements Dorso.entitlements \
    --sign "Apple Distribution: Thomas Johnell (KBF2YGT2KP)" \
    --timestamp \
    Dorso.app

# 3. Create installer package
rm -f Dorso.pkg
productbuild \
    --component Dorso.app /Applications \
    --sign "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: Thomas Johnell (KBF2YGT2KP)" \
    Dorso.pkg

# 4. Upload (ask user for app-specific password)
xcrun altool --upload-app -f Dorso.pkg -t macos -u tjohnell@gmail.com -p APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD
```

**Important:** The upload requires an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com. Ask the user to provide it when uploading - do not store it in files.

After upload:
1. Go to App Store Connect → App Store tab
2. Select the version (e.g., "1.0 Prepare for Submission")
3. Scroll to Build section → click + → select the new build
4. Answer Export Compliance: "No" (no encryption)
5. Save → Add for Review → Submit to App Review

### Auto-Update (Sparkle)

GitHub builds auto-update via Sparkle. App Store builds contain no trace of Sparkle (the `APP_STORE` flag compiles the code out and `-dead_strip_dylibs` removes the linkage) and update through the App Store itself.

- **Feed**: `appcast.xml` at the repo root, served from raw.githubusercontent.com (`SPARKLE_FEED_URL` in `build.sh`). An update goes live when appcast.xml lands on main; release.sh step 8 edits, commits, and pushes it automatically.
- **Update eligibility** is decided by comparing `BUILD_NUMBER` (CFBundleVersion), so `BUILD_NUMBER` must increase with every release, not just `VERSION`. release.sh aborts if `VERSION` in build.sh does not match the release argument.
- **Signing**: updates are EdDSA-signed. The private key lives in the login Keychain as "Private key for signing Sparkle updates" (public key: `SPARKLE_PUBLIC_ED_KEY` in `build.sh`). If the key is lost, shipped apps will reject future updates, so keep a backup. release.sh signs Sparkle's nested components before the app, then signs the final ZIP with `sign_update`. Never hand-edit appcast signatures.
- **ZIPs must be created with `ditto -c -k --keepParent`**: `zip -r` flattens Sparkle.framework's internal symlinks, which breaks the code signature and makes Sparkle reject the update.
- Sparkle CLI tools ship with the SwiftPM artifact at `.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/`.

## Build Configurations

- `./build.sh --dev` - Fast iteration: debug config, host arch only (~10s warm). Use this during development. Not suitable for distribution — debug binary, non-universal.
- `./build.sh` - Regular build with private APIs (release, universal, for GitHub/direct distribution)
- `./build.sh --appstore` - App Store build without private APIs
- `./build.sh --release` - Regular build + creates ZIP archive

## Installing During Development

**Always kill the existing process and remove old app before installing:**
```bash
pkill -x Dorso; rm -rf /Applications/Dorso.app && cp -r build/Dorso.app /Applications/
```

This prevents file locking issues and permission errors from code signing.

## Clearing Settings (Reset to Onboarding)

To reset the app and trigger the onboarding flow again:
```bash
pkill -x Dorso
rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.thelazydeveloper.posturr.plist
killall cfprefsd
```

Note: The bundle ID is `com.thelazydeveloper.posturr`, NOT `com.posturr`.

## Start Fresh (Rebuild + Reset + Launch)

To rebuild, reinstall, clear settings and permissions, and launch the app:
```bash
pkill -x Dorso; ./build.sh --dev && rm -rf /Applications/Dorso.app && cp -r build/Dorso.app /Applications/ && rm -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.thelazydeveloper.posturr.plist && killall cfprefsd 2>/dev/null && tccutil reset Camera com.thelazydeveloper.posturr 2>/dev/null && tccutil reset Motion com.thelazydeveloper.posturr 2>/dev/null && tccutil reset Bluetooth com.thelazydeveloper.posturr 2>/dev/null; open /Applications/Dorso.app
```

## Code Quality Rules

**NEVER use delays/timeouts to solve timing problems.** They are hacks that hide the real issue. Instead:
- Fix the actual sequencing/state management
- Use proper callbacks or completion handlers
- Wait for actual events, not arbitrary time periods

## Workflow for Bug Fixes and Features

**IMPORTANT: Never commit or push until the user explicitly asks you to.** After making changes:
1. Build and install the app
2. Wait for the user to test
3. Only commit when the user confirms it works or explicitly asks to commit

**Never comment on GitHub issues** until the user explicitly asks you to. The user will handle acknowledgments and issue comments.

## Version Bumping

Update both `VERSION` and `BUILD_NUMBER` in `build.sh` before releasing. Sparkle compares `BUILD_NUMBER` to decide whether an update is offered, so it must increase every release.

## Key Files

### Source Code (in `Sources/`)
- `App/DorsoMain.swift` - Executable entry point (everything else in `Sources/` builds as the testable `DorsoCore` library)
- `Core/` - Pure logic, no UI side effects
  - `TrackingFeature.swift` - TCA reducer owning tracking state; requests side effects as `EffectIntent` values via `TrackingRuntimeClient.perform`
  - `PostureEngine.swift` - Pure state-transition functions used by the reducer
  - `AppState.swift`, `Models.swift`, `PostureUIState.swift`, `Analytics.swift`, `Localization.swift`
- `AppDelegate/` - App coordinator, split by concern
  - `AppDelegate.swift` - Properties, lifecycle, store dispatch funnels (`applyTrackingAction` sync / `sendTrackingAction` async), and `performTrackingEffect` (the single place reducer effects execute)
  - `AppDelegate+Tracking.swift` - Detector/UI sync, source switching, monitoring, initial setup
  - `AppDelegate+Calibration.swift` - Calibration flow and its alerts
  - `AppDelegate+DeviceEvents.swift` - Camera hot-plug, display config, screen lock
  - `AppDelegate+Overlay.swift`, `AppDelegate+Persistence.swift`
- `Detectors/` - `CameraPostureDetector`, `AirPodsPostureDetector`, shared `PostureDetector` protocol
- `System/` - OS observers (camera hot-plug, display, screen lock) and global hotkey
- `Settings/` - Settings keys, migrations, profiles
- `UI/` - Menu bar, overlays (blur, warning), and windows (Settings, Calibration, Onboarding, Analytics, Support)

### Architecture Rules
- All tracking state lives in the TCA store; `AppDelegate` exposes computed accessors over it, never duplicate stored state.
- Every store dispatch goes through `applyTrackingAction`/`sendTrackingAction` so transition side effects (detector/UI sync) are never skipped.
- New reducer side effects: add an `EffectIntent` case and handle it in `performTrackingEffect`. Do not add ad-hoc callbacks.
- Tests must stay headless: nothing test-reachable in `DorsoCore` may require a window server (`swift test` must pass without one).

### Build & Release
- `build.sh` - Build script with App Store support
- `release.sh` - Full GitHub release automation
- `PRIVACY.md` - Privacy policy for App Store

## UI/UX Branding Guidelines

### Brand Colors
```swift
extension Color {
    static let brandCyan = Color(red: 0.31, green: 0.82, blue: 0.77)  // #4fd1c5 - from app icon
    static let brandNavy = Color(red: 0.10, green: 0.15, blue: 0.27)  // #1a2744 - from app icon
}
```

### Design Principles
- **Brand connection**: Use `brandCyan` for accents (sliders, toggles, selected states, buttons)
- **No system blue**: Replace default macOS blue with brand cyan
- **Subtle, not loud**: Use `.opacity(0.1)` to `.opacity(0.3)` for backgrounds/borders

### Window Layout
- Use `sizeThatFits` for auto-sizing windows to content
- Fixed width with auto height: `.frame(width: 640).fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)`
- Standard padding: `.padding(24)`

### Section Cards (SectionCard component)
- Rounded containers: `cornerRadius: 10`
- Background: `Color(NSColor.controlBackgroundColor)`
- Subtle border: `Color.primary.opacity(0.06)`
- Section header: Icon (brandCyan) + title (12pt semibold)
- Internal spacing: 12-14pt between items

### Typography
- Window title: 22pt semibold
- Section headers: 12pt semibold with SF Symbol icon
- Labels: 13pt regular
- Help text: 12pt in popovers
- Slider labels: 10-11pt secondary color

### Controls
- **Segmented pickers**: Custom `WarningStylePicker` with brandCyan selected state
- **Toggles**: `.tint(.brandCyan)`
- **Sliders**: `.tint(.brandCyan)` with value badge (pill with cyan background at 12% opacity)
- **Buttons**: brandCyan text/icon with 10% cyan background, 30% cyan border
- **Help icons**: `questionmark.circle` at 11pt, secondary color at 60% opacity

### Value Badges (for sliders)
```swift
Text(value)
    .font(.system(size: 12, weight: .medium))
    .foregroundColor(.brandCyan)
    .padding(.horizontal, 10)
    .padding(.vertical, 3)
    .background(Capsule().fill(Color.brandCyan.opacity(0.12)))
```

### Dividers
Use `SubtleDivider`: `Rectangle().fill(Color.primary.opacity(0.08)).frame(height: 1)`

### Header Pattern
- App icon (52x52 with subtle shadow)
- App name (22pt semibold) + tagline (12pt secondary)
- Social links (GitHub/Discord icons, 16x16, secondary color at 70% opacity)
- Version badge (11pt medium in capsule with 5% primary background)

### Social Icons
- Use official SVG paths from Simple Icons (GitHubIcon, DiscordIcon structs in SettingsWindow.swift)
- Add `.onHover` with `NSCursor.pointingHand` for pointer cursor
- Wrap in Link with `.contentShape(Rectangle())` for larger hit area

### Reference Implementation
See `SettingsWindow.swift` for the complete branded implementation.
